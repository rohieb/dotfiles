This is my personal dotfiles repo. Feel free to poke around and borrow from it.

Sadly, this repo currently does not contain all my dotfiles yet. I'm trying to
add the missing ones from time to time.

For a reproduction of my personal configuration files, clone this repo, then
update the submodules:

	$ git clone https://github.com/rohieb/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
	$ git submodule init && git submodule update

After that, you can set up symlinks in your home to point to the files in the
repo.
