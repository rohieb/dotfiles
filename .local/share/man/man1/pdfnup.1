.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
pdfnup [OPTION [OPTION] \&.\&.\&.] [SRC [PAGESPEC] [SRC [PAGESPEC]] \&.\&.\&.]
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
pdfnup converts files in the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF)
to "n-up" PDF files, that is, with multiple input pages 
per output page, for
more economical printing etc\&.  The default processing is to 2-up 
landscape output with no frame around pages, equivalent to using the 
options '--nup 2x1 --landscape true --frame false'.
.PP
If no source PDF file ('SRC') is specified, input
is from /dev/stdin. If 'PAGESPEC' is omitted, all pages are processed.
.PP
Source files are processed sequentially into a single output
unless the '--batch' option is used, in which case they are processed 
separately.
.PP 
pdfnup operates on one or more PDF files, and (either with the '--batch' 
option or with '--outfile DIR' where 'DIR' is a directory) the 
resulting files have
the suffix '-nup' applied to their names by default.  To change 
the suffix,
use the '--suffix' option, for example
.PP
.RS
.B    pdfnup --nup 2x2 --suffix '2x2' --batch myfile1.pdf myfile2.pdf
.RE
.PP 
will result in files named 'myfile1-2x2.pdf' and 'myfile2-2x2.pdf'.
