reStructuredText Headers
========================

Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain
characters as the structure is determined from the succession
of headings. However, this convention is used in Python
Developerâ€™s Guide for documenting which you may follow:

    # with overline, for parts
    * with overline, for chapters
    = for sections
    - for subsections
    ^ for subsubsections
    " for paragraphs
